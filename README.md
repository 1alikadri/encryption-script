# encryption-script
A versatile Bash script for encrypting and decrypting files using OpenSSL. It supports both symmetric (AES-256-CBC) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption methods, offering an easy-to-use command-line interface for secure data handling.
Features:

YOU DONT HAVE TO WRITE ANY COMMAND

Symmetric encryption for fast and secure file encryption.
Asymmetric encryption for file sharing using RSA keys.
Simplified key generation and file handling.
Ideal for quick encryption tasks or as a learning resource for OpenSSL-based file encryption techniques.

Usage:

Encrypt files securely using AES or RSA.
Generate private and public keys seamlessly.
Decrypt files with the corresponding keys.
Prerequisites:

OpenSSL installed on your system.

After adding the enc-dec.sh file make it executable by going to the directory its saved in and give the command chmod +x enc-dec.sh
after that you can run it by giving the command ./enc-dec.sh
